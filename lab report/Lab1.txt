Theory:
A lab environment is a collection of virtual and physical machines that we can use to develop and test applications.
A lab environment can contain multiple roles needed to test multi-tiered applications, such as workstations, web servers, and database servers.
In this lab,We have setup various Software such are Visual Studio Code : It is a  most usable text Editor from where we have easily coding debugging

it is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested by other software applications—which may run 
either on the same computer or on another computer across a network,Postman:Simplify workflows and create better APIs – faster , a collaboration
platform for API development.Git Bash:Git Bash is an application for Microsoft Windows environments which provides an emulation layer for a
Git command line experience.

Group Discussion:
We are installed required Software such are Visual Studio Code, Postman,GitBash,Sql Server etc.

Conclusion:
